MONTHLY WEATHER & WIND SUMMARY\n- The month's wind conditions were extremely calm, with an average wind speed of -0.299 m/s, which is significantly lower than the typical wind speeds required for substantial energy generation.\n- Compared to seasonal norms for the UK and Ireland, this month's wind conditions were notably below average, indicating a period of unusually low wind activity.\n- A notable weather event for this month is the complete absence of high-wind hours (>12 m/s) and the prevalence of low-wind hours, with 493 hours classified as such, and a calm fraction of 100.0%.\n- The BDH memory norm (avg) of 11.3137 suggests a high level of stability in the wind conditions, meaning that the predictability of the wind patterns was relatively high, but given the low wind speeds, this stability did not translate into favorable conditions for energy generation.\n\n## 2.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ESTIMATE\n- Estimated monthly revenue (\u00a3) = -0.7 MWh * \u00a398/MWh = \u00a3-69, as the energy generated is negative, indicating no revenue from power sales.\n- Estimated monthly O&M cost (\u00a3) = \u00a36,000,000 / 12 = \u00a3500,000.\n- Estimated monthly gross profit (\u00a3) = \u00a3-69 - \u00a3500,000 = \u00a3-500,069.\n- Lost revenue from low-wind hours = 493 hours * 210 MW * \u00a398/MWh = \u00a310,145,940.\n- Carbon avoided (tCO2e) = -0.7 MWh * 0.233 tCO2e/MWh = -0.2 tCO2e, indicating no significant carbon savings due to the lack of energy generation.\n\n## 4. PHYSICAL CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT (TCFD)\n- The primary risk from this month's BDH data is the exposure to low-wind conditions, which resulted in negligible energy generation and significant lost revenue.\n- Reference to SSE's TCFD disclosures would highlight the importance of managing such climate-related risks to ensure the long-term viability of renewable energy assets.\n- Risk rating: HIGH, due to the substantial financial impact of low-wind conditions on revenue and the carbon avoidance targets.\n\n## 5.

      "full_analysis_text": "## 1. MONTHLY WEATHER & WIND SUMMARY\n- The month's wind conditions were extremely calm, with an average wind speed of 0.525 m/s, which is significantly lower than the typical wind speeds for the UK and Ireland during this time of year. \n- Seasonal norms for October in the UK and Ireland usually involve moderate to strong winds, but this month was characterized by a complete lack of significant wind, with 100% of hours being classified as calm.\n- Notable weather events include the persistent calm conditions, with no hours exceeding 12 m/s and all 744 hours of the month being classified as low-wind.\n- The BDH memory norm (avg) of 11.3137 indicates a high level of stability in the wind conditions, suggesting that the calm conditions were consistent and predictable.\n\n## 2. ENERGY GENERATION ESTIMATE\n- Estimated capacity factor (%) = (avg power output / rated capacity) \u00d7 100. Given the average wind power proxy of 0.422, we can estimate the average power output. However, since the actual calculation of capacity factor from the wind power proxy is not provided, we will use the pre-computed capacity factor from the BDH output, which is 0.00%.\n- Estimated monthly energy (MWh) = capacity factor \u00d7 total capacity (MW) \u00d7 hours. Using the pre-computed energy generated from the BDH output, which is 5.7 MWh, we can confirm that the capacity factor is indeed very low.\n- Calculation steps:\n  - Capacity factor = 0.00% (pre-computed)\n  - Total capacity = 210 MW\n  - Hours in the month = 744\n  - Estimated monthly energy = 5.7 MWh (pre-computed)\n- Comparison to SSE's typical annual capacity factor targets: The estimated capacity factor of 0.00% is significantly lower than SSE's typical annual capacity factor targets of 35-40% for onshore wind farms.\n\n## 3. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ESTIMATE\n- Estimated monthly revenue (\u00a3) = MWh generated \u00d7 \u00a398/MWh. Using the pre-computed energy generated of 5.7 MWh, we can calculate the revenue.\n  - Estimated monthly revenue = 5.7 MWh \u00d7 \u00a398/MWh = \u00a3559\n- Estimated monthly O&M cost (\u00a3) = annual O&M / 12. Given the annual O&M cost of \u00a36M, we can calculate the monthly O&M cost.\n  - Estimated monthly O&M cost = \u00a36M / 12 = \u00a3500,000\n- Estimated monthly gross profit (\u00a3) = revenue \u2212 O&M.\n  - Estimated monthly gross profit = \u00a3559 - \u00a3500,000 = \u00a3-499,441\n- Lost revenue from low-wind hours = low-wind hours \u00d7 fleet capacity \u00d7 \u00a398/MWh. Given 744 low-wind hours and a fleet capacity of 210 MW, we can calculate the lost revenue.\n  - Lost revenue = 744 hours \u00d7 210 MW \u00d7 \u00a398/MWh = \u00a315,311,520\n- Carbon avoided (tCO2e) = MWh \u00d7 0.233 tCO2e/MWh. Using the pre-computed energy generated of 5.7 MWh, we can calculate the carbon avoided.\n  - Carbon avoided = 5.7 MWh \u00d7 0.233 tCO2e/MWh = 1.3 tCO2e\n\n## 4. PHYSICAL CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT (TCFD)\n- The BDH data indicates a high risk of low-wind exposure, with 100% of hours being classified as calm. This suggests that the wind farm is highly vulnerable to periods of low wind, which can significantly impact revenue.\n- The lack of significant wind events or storms during the month suggests a low risk of storm damage.\n- Risk rating: HIGH, due to the high risk of low-wind exposure and the significant impact it can have on revenue.\n\n## 5. SSE STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT\n- This month's performance does not align with SSE's net zero 2050 target, as the low energy generation and high lost revenue from low-wind hours suggest that the wind farm is not operating at optimal levels.\n- Reference to SSE's TCFD disclosures from the RAG documents suggests that the company is committed to managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n- The high lost revenue from low-wind hours highlights the importance of managing CfD exposure and merchant price risk.\n\n## 6. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS\n- 1. **Conduct a thorough review of the wind farm's performance**: Analyze the BDH data and other relevant metrics to identify areas for improvement and optimize the wind farm's performance.\n- 2. **Diversify revenue streams**: Consider exploring alternative revenue streams, such as battery storage or grid services, to reduce dependence on wind energy and mitigate the impact of low-wind hours.\n"
